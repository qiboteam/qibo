Welcome to Qibo!
================

Qibo is a Python library for classical simulation of quantum algorithms.
Qibo provides a standard interface for the implementation and extension of
quantum algorithms in double precision. Simulation takes full advantage of
hardware accelerators such as GPU and CPU with multi-threading support.
The package includes a multi-GPU distributed approach for circuit simulation.
