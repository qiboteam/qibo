Qibo is an open-source full stack API for quantum simulation and quantum hardware control.
Qibo aims to contribute as a community driven quantum middleware software with

1. *Simplicity:* agnostic design to quantum primitives.
2. *Flexibility:* transparent mechanism to execute code on classical and quantum hardware.
3. *Community:* a common place where find solutions to accelerate quantum development.
4. *Documentation:* describe all steps required to support new quantum devices or simulators.
5. *Applications:* maintain a large ecosystem of applications, quantum models and algorithms.
